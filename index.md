## Who are we?

`#include<C++>` is a global, inclusive, and diverse community for developers interested in C++. Here, you can find a welcoming space to learn and discuss C++. We also provide resources to create safer, more inclusive, community gatherings.

We believe that a community is only as good as how it treats its most vulnerable members. Therefore, we strive to create a welcoming, safe, and accessible environment. You can find our code of conduct [here](/code-of-conduct).

The moderation and administration team are [Patricia Aas](https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo), [Simon Brand](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama), [Noam Chitayat](https://twitter.com/_Noam), [Guy Davidson](https://twitter.com/hatcat01), [Timur Doumler](https://twitter.com/timur_audio), [Kate Gregory](https://twitter.com/gregcons), [Adi Shavit](https://twitter.com/AdiShavit), [Fred Tingaud](https://twitter.com/FredTingaudDev), and others.

## What do we do?

We are still in the process of getting set up, but we plan to provide the following:

- A set of [resources](/resources) on diversity and inclusion.
- An inclusive, welcoming space for people to discuss and learn C++.
  - We have a Discord server. The public invite is currently closed, but you can get a personal invite by contacting us below or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/include_cpp).
- A [toolbox](https://github.com/include-cpp/toolboxes/releases/latest) for C++ conferences to improve diversity and inclusion.
- Help for conferences in reaching minority groups with calls for papers, and suggesting candidates to invite to speak.
- Help for companies in improving their C++ job advertisements to improve appeal to minority groups.
- Help for minorities and junior programmers in submitting talks for conferences or job applications.

## Why make another organisation?

There are many organisations focused on improving diversity and inclusion in the tech space. However, we are in a very good place to target the C++ community specifically, because many of those involved are C++ experts with connections to conferences and companies where a difference can be made.
